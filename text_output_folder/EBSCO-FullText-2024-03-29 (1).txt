  In a streaming environment, data is continuously generated and processed in 
an ongoing manner, and it is necessary to detect fraudulent transactions 
quickly to prevent significant financial losses. Hence, this paper proposes a 
machine learning -based approa ch for detecting fraudulent transactions in a 
streaming environment, with a focus on addressing concept drift. The 
approach utilizes the extreme gradient boosting ( XGBoost ) algorithm. 
Additionally, the approach employs four algorithms for detecting continu ous 
stream drift. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, two datasets are 
used: a credit card dataset and a Twitter dataset containing financial fraud -
related social media data. The approach is evaluated using cross -validation 
and the results demon strate that it outperforms traditional machine learning 
models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, and is more robust to 
concept drift. The proposed approach can be utilized as a real -time fraud 
detection system in various industries, including fi nance, insurance, and  
e-commerce.  Keyword s:

1. INTRODUCTION  
The growth of the internet significantly aid different organization/fields such as social media, In 
recent years, credit card fraud has been increasing since there is an increase in the usage of the internet [1]. 
Nowadays, many people have started utilizing their credit cards for various kinds of transactions and many 
people fall to scammers which may lead to fraud cases [2]. Credit card fraud refers to a scammer utilizing the 
user’s credit card number and personal identification number  (PIN) or the user ’s stolen credit card for 
financial transactions from the user’s account without their knowledge. Credit card scams fall under identity 
theft and have become increasingly common nowadays [3], [4] . There are various ways through which cred it 
card information is usually stolen. Some examples are skimming, dumpster diving, hacking, and phishing [5]. 
In addition, many scammers are employing Twitter bots to convince misguided users to send money to 
compromised PayPal as well as Venmo accounts. The bots seem to be launched whenever a genuine user 
request  another one for their payment details, probably obtaining such tweets through a query for terms like 
PayPal, Venmo, or even other providers. By stealing another user ’s profile photo and coming up with an 
identical username, they can pa ss themselves off as them while asking for money from the actual tweeter. 
Moreover, in the past few years, Twitter spam has gotten progressively worse. Twitter ’s massive user base 
and the volume of information exchanged there both contribute significantly to the rapid spread of spam [6]. 
Twitter and the research community have been creating several spam detection systems by utilizing various 
machine -learning approaches to protect users [7]. However, a recent study found that because the features of

spam tweets change over time (data imbalance and concept drift), the current machine learning -based 
detection methods are unable t o identify spam with accuracy. Due to data imbalance and concept drift [8], 
[9], fraud detection and spam detection is a particularly difficult task. Additionally, fraud detection models 
and spam detection models diff er from conventional classification in that in the initial phase, human 
investigators only supply a small set of supervised samples and only have time to evaluate a small number of 
alerts. The vast majority of transaction labels are  not made available unti l a few days later, after customers 
may have detected fraud. When learning in a concept -drifting environment, it is important to carefully 
evaluate the delay in getting precise labels and the interaction between alerts and supervised information. 
Due to al l these problems, there is a requirement for a model which can detect spam and fraud which has data 
imbalance and concept drift issues. Hence, in this paper, we propose a model which provides a solution to 
these problems. Furthermore, the significance of t he research is: i) the continuous stream drift -identification 
(CSDI) employ an effective cross -validation scheme for selecting meaningful feature during the training of 
the predictive model  and ii) the CSDI -based attack detection model achieves much better  accuracy, recall, 
and F -measure performance in comparison with the existing ensemble -based classification model.  
 
 
2. LITERATURE SURVEY  
This section provides various research work done to address the concept drift issues and also the 
class imbalance issues w hich affect the overall accuracy during classification or prediction. Bayram  et al.  
[10] have presented a review of various concept drift methods which have been used over the years. They 
discussed t he various works which have been done to resolve the issue of concept drift. Further, they have 
discussed how machine learning (ML) can help to reduce these issues. In this paper, the researchers have also 
classified the various models based on their performance. They have mentioned the challenges and possible 
research directions when working with a concept drift issue. Mayaki and  Riveill  [11] have proposed a 
detection model for t he concept drift. This model was built based on an autoregressive model known as 
application discovery and dependency mapping ( ADDM ). In [12], a method called EIStream was proposed to 
detect the concept drift by utilizing the ensemble and traditional ML techniques on both artificia l and real -
time data. Moreover, the EIStream model uses the majority voting method, allowing just the best classifier to 
cast a vote and decide which classifier is the best. Further, according to [13], for the detection of the data and 
the issue of the concept drift, they have first proposed a drift detection strategy that makes use of the 
principal -component -analysis (PCA) approach to analyze the constant changes in the variance of the 
characteristics throughout the intrusion detection data streams for the detection of the data and concept drifts. 
To resolve these drift issues, this method has discussed an online deep neural network (DNN) which 
automatically changes or adjusts the size of the hidden layers in the neural network based on the hedge 
weighting technique , hence, this enables the method to easily learn the intrusion and adapt to any n ew 
intrusion. Jayaratne  et al.  [14] reviewed the existing concept drift models and concluded that the existing 
concept drift detection techniques are depende nt on the classifier and need labeled data. However, the cyber -
physical system (CPS) data streams are dynamically unstructured and unlabeled. Jayaratne  et al.  [14] have 
proposed an unsupervised ML model which constantly detects the concept drift in the industrial cyber -
physical system . Priya and Uthra  [15] have proposed a model, CIDD -ADODNN, which is efficient for the 
detection of class imbalance and concept drift issues by employing the ADADELTA -optimizer -based dee p-
neural -networks  (ADODNN). This model is used to preprocess the streaming data into class imbalance and 
concept drift, handle the class imbalance and detect the concept drift and finally classify severely imbalanced 
streaming data.  
The ADO -based hyperpar ameter tuning procedure [16] is used to find the DNN  model’s ideal 
parameters to improve the classifier performance. Liu et al.  [17] have demonstrated how the current data 
augmentation techniques either neglect the distribution of data or the spatial relationships among the features. 
To overcome the above problem, the researchers have suggest ed a network anomaly detection method using 
the convolutional neural network (CNN) which is based on data augmentation and feature representation 
(NADS -RA). With the aid of the least-squares generative -adversarial -network , which mitigates the impact of 
an unbalanced training set and prevents over -fitting. Also, an image -based augmentation method is created to 
create an augmented image under the distribution pattern of rare network anomaly images . Following that, 
NADS -RA is applied to the CNN  classification model. Zhou  et al.  [18] have proposed an algorithm, 
correlation feature  selection using the bat algorithm ( CFS-BA), for intrusion detection systems which is 
based on ensemble and feature selection methods. The proposed algorithm chooses the best subset based on 
the correlation among the various features which has been present ed in the initial stage for the dimensionality 
reduction. Yotsawat  et al.  [19], they have proposed a novel ensemble method known as the cost-sensitive 
neural network ensemble (CS-NNE) for creating a credit scoring model based on a cost -sensitive neural 
network. The multi -base neural networks can take into account unbalanced classes in the suggested method 
because multiple class weights are modified to the o riginal training data. A novel ensemble architecture that                 ISSN : 2088 -8708

may successfully identify various attack types is proposed in [20]. The suggested method relies on rankin g 
the detection capabilities of multiple base classifiers to recognize distinct sorts of attacks. The rank matrix for 
various attack categories is computed using the F1 -score of an algorithm. Only the output from algorithms 
with the greatest F1 -Score in th e rank matrix for a certain attack category is taken into account for the final 
prediction. The voting strategy, in contrast, bases the final classification on the vote of all classifiers in the 
ensemble, regardless of whether the algorithm is effective en ough to identify that assault or not.  
 
 
3. METHOD  
In this section, we discuss the standard XGBoost  algorithm and its cross -validation. Further, we 
present a concept drift aware -machine learning framework and in the final section of the proposed 
methodology, a continuous stream drift identification model has been proposed. The standard XGBoost 
model [21], this model has an improved cross -validation technique which has been used for  the selection of 
only the useful features. In the below section, the standard XGBoost model has been given.  
 
3.1.  Standard XGBoost model  
The proposed model utilizes the standard XGBoost model which has been proposed in [21]. The 
standard XGBoost model in this proposed model has been used for classifying and training whether any scam  
or fraud is being happened during any transaction. In the standard XGBoost technique, the ℎ𝑝 has been used 
for assuring minimal loss using the greedy technique used which has been shown in (1) . 
 
𝑁𝑝≅∑ [𝑛(𝑎̂𝑘(𝑃−1)+𝑎𝑘)+𝑖𝑘ℎ𝑘(𝑧𝑘)+1
2𝑗𝑘ℎ𝑝2(𝑧𝑘)]+𝛽(ℎ𝑝)𝑝
𝑘=1  
 
∝∑ [𝑖𝑘ℎ𝑘(𝑧𝑘)+1
2𝑗𝑘[ℎ𝑝(𝑧𝑘)2]]+𝛽(ℎ𝑝)𝑝
𝑘=1 (1) 
 
In the (1) the 𝑗𝑘 has been defined for second -order gradient descent 𝑛(𝑎̂𝑘(𝑃−1)+𝑎𝑘) of and ℎ𝑗 has been 
defined for first -order gradient descent of 𝑛(𝑎̂𝑘(𝑃−1)+𝑎𝑘). Hence, the tree of the XGBoost model ℎ𝑝 can be 
attained by reducing (1). The loss function for the tree is evaluated using (2) . 
 
𝒩𝑦=−∑ (𝛼𝑎𝑘log(𝑎̂𝑘)+(1−𝑎𝑘)log(1−𝑎̂𝑘))𝑞
𝑘=1 (2) 
 
In (2) the 𝛼 is defined for the bias function which is used for describing the feature imbalance. For 
optimizing the f eature imbalance, cross -validation is used. The cross -validation technique is constructed 
using various sets of 𝐾 folds instead of using one set of 𝐾 folds. For evaluating a single fold having cross -
validation is using (3).  
 
𝐶𝑉(𝜎)=1
𝑀∑ ∑ 𝑃(𝑏𝑗,𝑔̂𝜎−𝑘(𝑗)(𝑦𝑗,𝜎))𝑗∈𝐺−𝑘𝐾
𝑘=1  (3) 
 
The (3) fails to provide a good result when the data contains imbalanced values. Hence for reducing 
the error in the cross -validation,  Shahapurkar and Rodd  [21] has proposed cross -validation having two layers. 
These layers contain the main features of the dataset and features which have been selected using the  first 
layer. These two layers are used for constructing a prediction model. The two -layer cross -validation 
technique is evaluated using (4) . 
 
𝐶𝑉(𝜎)=1
𝑆𝑀∑ ∑ ∑ 𝑃(𝑏𝑗,𝑔̂𝜎−𝑘(𝑗)(𝑦𝑗,𝜎))𝑗∈𝐺−𝑘𝐾
𝑘=1𝑆
𝑠=1  (4) 
 
From the cross -validation, for optimizing the parame ters and for the selection of an optimal value, 
(5) is used . 
 
𝜎̂=argmin
𝜎∈{𝜎1,…,𝜎𝑙}𝐶𝑉𝑠(𝜎) (5) 
 
In (4), P(∙) is used to define the gradient loss parameter, 𝑔̂𝜎−𝑘(𝑗)(∙) is used for the estimation of the 
coefficients, and the training size is defined using M. Using the standard XGBoost model with  
cross -validation, this technique can provide better results even when there are multiple optimization 
parameters.  Int J Elec & Comp Eng   ISSN:  2088 -8708  

3.2.  Concept drift aware -machine learning framework  
The work uses the drift detection model presented in [21] for designing an impro ved drift detection 
mechanism for a streaming environment. The framework of the proposed concept drifts aware machine 
learning fo r detecting fraudulent transactions in streaming environments is given in algorithm 1. In  
algorithm 1, first, the XGB classifi er is trained to detect whether a given transaction is normal or malicious. 
Then, the work uses K -L divergence for identifying distribution between different streams (i.e., present and 
past data distribution) using the XGB classifier. Then, continuous  stream drift -identification (CSDI) is 
designed to identify whether the current data stream is different from past data streams; if the drift is true, 
establish the drift period. Then, these streams after the drift period are used for updating the classifier. T hen, 
the updated classifier is tested with new streams for validating the model.

Step 11. Stop  
 
3.3.  Continuous stream drift identification model  
In this section, the continuous stream drift identification model. The algori thm to identify drift on 
continuous stream data is given in algorithm 2. In this work obtaining a subwindow, X undersampling 
process is executed on a static window. After that, the work applies a continuous stream drift identification 
process on the subwin dow and test window W using algorithm  3. Then, the present drift pointer is considered 
to be in static nature if the outcome is negative and is added to the static window.

Step 15.    End if  
Step 16. Construct identification feature for S 
Step 17. End ∀ 
Step 18. Stop  
 
Nonetheless, if the outcome of algorithm 3 is positive, then test window W is further analyzed using 
continuous stream drift identification using algorithm 4 for localizing the drift point. If the drift point is 
identified, the proposed CSDI methodology is optimized with data from the drift point to the current instance. 
Further, when the model is expected to overflow then half of the points in S are discarde d. 
Every group of streams builds at least one drift indicator Sw at given session instance as:  
 
𝑆𝑤=1−1
𝑛𝑤∑ [ℎ∗(𝑎𝑤(𝑗)−𝑏𝑤(𝑗))]2.𝑛𝑤
𝑗=1                  ISSN : 2088 -8708  
Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 5, October  2023: 5560 -5568  5564  
In particular the parameter h*(∙) is a pretrained model learned using the preceding static state. The parameter 
aw(j) defines features of 𝑗th stream at session window 𝑤 and the parameter bw(j) defines the label of 𝑗th  
stream at session window w. Thus, 1−1
𝑛𝑤∑ [ℎ∗(𝑎𝑤(𝑗)−𝑏𝑤(𝑗))]2 𝑛𝑤
𝑗=1 in above equation computes the mean 
accuracies of entire nw data streams in a group. Once obtaining the drift identifier S and divide it into 𝑋̂and 
𝑊, in an iterative manner randomly select streams from 𝑋̂ for obtaining X until |𝑋|=|𝑊|. In general, the 
test window size |𝑊| provides larger significance assuring that X is representative for 𝑋̂. However, at the 
same time because of larger size induces a higher delay for the accumulation of streams; thus, this paper 
introduces a sub -session -based drift identification test for establishing good drift point accuracies. This  work 
further assumes that 𝐻:|𝜇𝑥−𝜇𝑤|>0. There may exist certain drift points in the test window if the outcome 
is positive. Thus, the prerequisite is to further perform continuous stream drift identification on sub -session -
based drift identification for  localizing the perfect drift point. In improving computational efficiency in this 
work using algorithm 4 is used for dividing the test window into static and non -static ones. Let 
𝑋(1):{𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋𝑛} be self -determining streams with 𝑋~𝑁(𝛽1,𝜎2). Let 𝑊(2):{𝑊1,𝑊2,…,𝑊𝑛−𝑚} be  
self-determining streams with  𝑊(1) ~𝑁(𝛽1,𝜎2), 𝑊(2):{𝑊𝑛−𝑚+1,𝑊𝑛−𝑚+2,…,𝑊𝑛} with  𝑊(2) ~𝑁(𝛽2,𝜎2) 
and 𝑊=𝑊(1)∪𝑊(1). 𝑋̅, 𝑊(1) ̅̅̅̅̅̅, 𝑊(2) ̅̅̅̅̅̅ and 𝑊̅defines its streams average, respectively. Let E(∙) defines the 
anticipated outcome of an arbitrary parameter. If 𝑚≥𝜇𝑛, where 𝜇=[1/(1+(𝑤𝛾(𝑛−2)

𝐸(𝑊(1) ̅̅̅̅̅̅)−𝐸(𝑊(2) ̅̅̅̅̅̅)>0, then: 𝐸(𝑋̅)−𝐸(𝑊̅)>0.

The work assumes that the last 𝑚 points in W are the ideal drift points. The streams X and W are 
expected to be different if there exists substantial variation between the two parts 𝑊(1) and 𝑊(2) in W. The 
motivating factor is using total session -based drift identification minimum quantity of drift points can be 
extracted; if not enough points are established then it is difficult to get a positive outcome; thus, if we can claim 
variance between X and W, therefore statistically it is impossible to have a significant difference between 
𝑊(1)and 𝑊(2). Based on such an assumption, algorithm 4 efficiently e stablished the ideal drift point.  
 
 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
In this section, we discuss the metrics used for calculating the results. From the performance 
metrics, we evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall , F1-score , and false positive rate (FPR) for the  credit card 
dataset. For comparing the results, we have used the standard machine learning models, support vector 
machine (SVM) [17], random forest (RF) [17], decision tree (DT) [17], network anomaly detection scheme -
representation and augmentati on (NADS -RA) [17], generative adversar ial networks (GAN) [22], standar d 
XGBoost, and the proposed model. Similarly, using the performance metrics, we evaluate the accuracy, 
recall, and F1 score. To compare the results w ith the existing models, we have used the standard machine 
learning model, RF [23], k-nearest -neighbor (KNN) [23], SVM  [23], XGBoost [24], and data imbalance 
aware XGBoost (DIA -XGBoost) [24] and the proposed CSDI model. After this, we evaluated the drift time 
detection of our model. Further, discuss the data imb alance and drift problems in the credit card dataset [25] 
and Twitter spam dataset [26].

KNN, RF, XGBoost, ensemble , and DIA -XGB attained an F1 -score of 0.2, 0.653, 0.8033, 0.8677, 0.9008, and 
0.9677 respectively. The proposed model attained an F1 score of 0.9538.

4.3.2. Drift time  
In this section, the drift time of the dataset for the Twitter spam dataset has been explained. The 
accuracy, recall, and F -measure has been shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5 respectively. The results have been 
compared with the MDDT +XGB [24] model which mainly focuses on the drift. This model also handles the 
drift using an ensemble model which also uses the XGBoost model. The accuracy performance of the 
MDDT+XGB keeps fluctuating each day as seen in Figure 3. The proposed model’s accuracy remains 
constant and keeps on decreasing as the no of days increases. There is a drop after the 5th day as the drift 
increases in the data. In Figure 4, the recall performance of 5 days performance can  be seen. Similar to the

accuracy the recall also keeps fluctuating each day for the recall. The proposed model is constant and 
decreases as the number of days increases. In Figure 5, the F -measure can be seen where the existing model 
increases on the 2nd day but drop after the 3rd day. The F -measure of the proposed model remains constant 
throughout the 5 days. Hence, the proposed model is better than the existing model in handling the drift.

5. CONCLUSION  
In this paper, first, we have studied how class imbalance and concept drift problems arise in data and 
how it affects the overall system during classification and detection. Further,  we have studied the various 
models which have been presented to detect class imbalance and concept drift. After this, we have presented 
a model which addresses the data imbalance and drifts problems during the detection. Furthermore, we have 
experimented with our model with the credit card fraud dataset and Twitter spam dataset. The results show 
that the proposed model attains higher accuracy when compared with the existing systems for both datasets. 
The proposed model provides an opportunity for addressin g the class imbalance and drift issues in a given 
dataset and predicts better when compared with the existing models. The current proposed model can detect 
better with credit card fraud and Twitter spam datasets. For future work, we would try to improve th e model 
to attain higher performance metrics with other datasets.
